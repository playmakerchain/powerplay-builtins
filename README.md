# thor-builtins Powerplay fork

This is the official fork of thor-builtins used in Powerplay. If you're building a dapp you will be running this fork as it's integrated in the dapp development package of the powerplay network. 

It's important to note - if you use the main thor-builtins codebase in the PowerPlay Network your node will not commmunicate with the PowerPlay network nodes thus reducing the security of your dapps. 

## Modifications

The builtin contracts including "authority.sol", "energy.sol", "extension.sol", "params.sol", "prototype.sol" and "executor.sol". You can check the source code of these contracts by visiting: https://github.com/vechain/thor/blob/master/builtin/gen. We will give a detailed description of these contracts and teach you how to use it in your dapp. Some simple examples generated by truffle will be given and you can run it in VechainThor testnet.
