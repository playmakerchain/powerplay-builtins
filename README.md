# thor-builtins Powerplay fork

This is the official fork of thor-builtins used in Powerplay. If you're building a dapp you will be running this fork as it's integrated in the `dapp development package` of the powerplay network. 

It's important to note - if you use the main thor-builtins codebase in the PowerPlay Network your node will not commmunicate with the PowerPlay network nodes thus reducing the security of your dapps.
